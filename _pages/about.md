I'm a computational biologist specialized in machine learning method development for inference from genomic data. I hold a B.A. in Chemistry from Bryn Mawr College (Pennsylvania) and a Ph.D. in Genetics with double minors in Molecular Medicine and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology from the University of Arizona. Prior to computational work, I was broadly trained for 6+ years in various wet lab settings from organic synthetic chemistry, protein crystallography, to cell biology and virology.

My current research lies at the intersection of deep learning and genomics, where I develop deep learning methods for inference of population history and natural selection from genomic variation data. I'm especially interested in problems regarding the interepretability and uncertainty quantification of deep learning models in population genetics. For more details on my present and past projects, see [Projects](https://lntran26.github.io/projects).
