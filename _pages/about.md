I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Genetics Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP) at the University of Arizona. Originally trained as a wet lab chemist/biologist, I transitioned into the world of computational biology in 2020 and have been hooked ever since. Currently, I'm working on my doctoral dissertation projects in the [Guntekunst Research Group](https://www.gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu/) in the exciting field of population genomics. My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and genomics, where I develop deep learning methods for inference of population history and natural selection from genomic variation data. For more details on my present and past projects, see [Projects](https://lntran26.github.io/projects).

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I came to the United States in 2012 to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania. After college, I worked at the University of Pennsylvania for two years as a lab technician before moving to Tucson, Arizona for graduate school in 2018. I'm graduating with a Ph.D. in Genetics in August 2024 and am currently open to post-PhD positions, broadly at the intersection of computational methods and genomics. Outside of research, I enjoy crocheting/knitting, taking care of my house plants, and studying languages (currently Korean and Chinese).
