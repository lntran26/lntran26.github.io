I'm a computational genomics researcher experienced in bioinformatics analysis, pipeline development, and machine learning methods for genomic data. I hold a B.A. in Chemistry from Bryn Mawr College (Pennsylvania) and a Ph.D. in Genetics with double minors in Molecular Medicine and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology from the University of Arizona. Prior to computational work, I was broadly trained for 6+ years in various wet lab settings from organic synthetic chemistry, protein crystallography, to cell biology and virology. My current research focuses on developing robust computational methods for inference of population history and natural selection from genomic variation datas. For more details on my present and past projects, see [Projects](https://lntran26.github.io/projects).
